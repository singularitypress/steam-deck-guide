## Tools

### Launcher

PolyMC - on the Discover store https://polymc.org/

### Mods

- Controller support: Controllable https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/controllable

## Instructions

- Install PolyMC from the Discover Software Centre on Steam Deck, or [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.polymc.PolyMC) directly for desktop Linux.
- Launch PolyMC and add your account in the top right corner. _It supports both Mojang and Microsoft logins._
- Go into the main PolyMC Settings, click Minecraft in the left panel and click the option to close PolyMC when the game window opens. Otherwise, loading in Game Mode / Deck UI on Steam Deck it will flicker between the two windows.
- Ensure in the PolyMC Settings that Java is set to the latest version, which is needed for the latest Minecraft.
- Click Add Instance in the top left, then pick either normal Minecraft or find some mods with the built-in search and it installs everything you need for you.
- To be able to launch directly from Steam: go to the Games menu up the top -> click add a Non-Steam game and then find PolyMC in the list.
